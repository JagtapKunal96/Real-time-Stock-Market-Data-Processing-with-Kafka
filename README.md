# Real-time-Stock-Market-Data-Processing-with-Kafka

Objective:
Build a robust and comprehensive data pipeline to extract, transform, and analyse real-time stock market data using AWS services.

Project Description:
Create a robust data processing pipeline to extract, transform, store, and analyse real-time stock market data. The project utilizes Kafka and AWS services for seamless data flow and insights generation.

Data Generation: Generate real-time stock market data using a Kafka producer on an EC2 instance.
Data Streaming: Stream the generated data to a Kafka topic for processing.
Transformation: Use a Kafka consumer to extract and transform data into JSON format.
Storage: Store the transformed data in an AWS S3 bucket for efficient and scalable storage.
Analytics: Utilize AWS Glue to manage data tables, define schema, and AWS Athena for querying.
Insights: Analyse data through statistical methods and visualizations for trends and patterns.
Automation: Implement AWS Lambda for automated ETL processes triggered by new data.
